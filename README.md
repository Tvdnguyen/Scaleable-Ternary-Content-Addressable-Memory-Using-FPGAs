# Scaleable-Ternary-Content-Addressable-Memory-Using-FPGAs
Content addressable memory (CAM) and ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) are specialized high-speed memories for data search- ing. This project proposes a scaleable algorithmic TCAM design on FPGA. The design uses memory blocks to negate power dissipation issue and data collision to save area. The project also presents a design of a 256
x 104-bit algorithmic TCAM on Intel FPGA Cyclone V, evaluates the performance and application ability of the design on large scale and in future developments.
